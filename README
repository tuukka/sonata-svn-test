Sonata, a simple GTK+ client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
Copyright 2006 Scott Horowitz <stonecrest@gmail.com>

Thanks to Andrew Conkling, et al, for all their hard work on Pygmy!
Sonata is a fork of the Pygmy project.

For information on MPD, please see http://musicpd.org.  Their wiki is
also a great resource: http://mpd.wikicities.com

Installation:
In the sonata directory, run 'python setup.py install --prefix=/path'
(where 'path' is '/usr' or '/usr/share', usually).  If you're able
and willing to create various distribution packages/build scripts,
please let me know so I can put them on the website.

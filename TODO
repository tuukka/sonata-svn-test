v0.7
	ability to configure columns for playlist
	ability to show column headings for sorting

Future:
	popup notification on a new song (enable/disable, delay)
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	border around album art?
	pref to autoplay when using 'replace'?
	use threading for album art
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	Stream support(?)
	treeview instead of listview? (expanding, collapsing..)
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?

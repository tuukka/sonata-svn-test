v0.9
	USE COMMAND_LIST_* for batch processes (i.e. remove, crop, add_*)
		Add to > Next song, top, random
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	make remote images non-blocking (add search bar at bottom?)
	use pygtk's systemtray support
	remove case sensitivity for library

Future:
	allow multiple columns?
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?

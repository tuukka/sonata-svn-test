lyrics not found error overrides lyrics on song change (syncing of lyrics)

v1.1
	last.fm support
	use plchanges to keep track of the playlist (faster)
	ability to 'save all' for tag editing? shortcut or button?
	speed up sorting by manipulating self.songs, self.currentdata appropriately?

Future:
	lyrics -> allow user to edit, fetch, auto-update to wiki, search terms..?
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	libnotify?
	switching between user profiles?
	test multiple streams at once..
	local amazon sites (i.e. amazon.de)?
	rename playlist (only possible in mpd svn?)

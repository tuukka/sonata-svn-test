v1.6
	empty string searching doesn't work with mpd < 0.14...
	threaded method for artwork - possible threading traceback when exiting sonata
	fullscreen artwork:
		- remove 500x500 hardcode
		- show currently playing song
	enabling/disabling outputs
	prevent vertical resizing when collapsed 
	save to playlist.. default to selected files? pref?
	sonata freezes with gail/accessibility enabled during new library searching
	tag editing 
		- support for composer, disc
		- save selection afterwards (what did we have before?)
	remove libegg? statusicon provides everything in gtk 2.15, not yet in pygtk
	albumartist tag

Future:
	support for new idle command (waiting on python-mpd)
	work with mpd's new "allow authenticated local users to add any local file to the playlist"
		- waiting on python-mpd to implement unix socket paths
		- dnd from a file manager (implemented and untested because of above)
		- new library browsing mode to open any file?
		  remember: no tags and implications for remote mpd users.
	crop songs in current playlist?
	mpd statistics
	use GtkVolumeButton?
	better playlist support (mpd 0.13+ only):
		ability to view songs, reorder songs, remove songs, etc

		- limit dependencies between modules
	style:
		- rewrite unpythonic or complicated parts
		- fix reasonable pychecker/pylint warnings
	tests:
		- write automated tests
		- refactor code into parts that can be tested
	use the logging module:
		- add verbose and debug logging modes
		- log to file if not running on console
	exceptions:
		- add class restrictions to most "except:" clauses
		- add debug logging to most except clauses
	threading:
		- design, document, and implement a bug-free use of threads

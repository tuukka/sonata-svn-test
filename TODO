v0.8
	song properties (metadata)
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar

Future:
	allow multiple columns?
	Stream support
	Add to > Next song, top, random - too slow...
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?

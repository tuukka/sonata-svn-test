v1.0
	support for PLS, M3U, etc (http://www.scvi.net/pls.htm) if mpd
		doesn't support it natively (feature request filed)
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?
	add year to format tab
	ability to set an album art by drag & drop
	if song's folder contains one graphical file set, this file as album art

Future:
	USE COMMAND_LIST_* for batch processes (i.e. remove, crop, add_*)
		Add to > Next song, top, random
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	lyrics? last.fm?

todo:
	- check CHANGELOG
	- keybindings
	- settings to stop mpd, clear playlist on app exit
	- don't show tooltip after (un)withdrawing until mouse moves
	- use threading for album art

Future:
	why the hell won't the progress bar get any less wide????
	ability to set art from local image?
	ability to configure columns for playlist
	ability to show column headings for sorting
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	retain selection after dnd
	Playlist file support(?)
	Stream support(?)
	Documentation
	Translations

v1.4
	pref for lyrics saving location..
	allow additional columns for library (like current)
	genre mode (genre -> artist -> album)
	better playlist support (mpd 0.13 only):
		playlist tab:
			ability to view songs, reorder songs, remove songs, etc
		current tab:
			- save... >
				new playlist...
				to existing playlist... ---> popup window with dropdown of playlists
				...
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	speed up sorting by manipulating model (generic functions to swap/move model items)

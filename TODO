0.6
	Playlist support (tab in notebook)
	ability to set art from local image ("Set from file...")
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length)

Future:
	support for multimedia keys
	border around album art?
	use threading for album art
	retain selection after dnd
	ability to configure columns for playlist
	ability to show column headings for sorting
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	Stream support(?)

v0.8
	Add to > Next song, bottom, top?
	pref to update db on opening sonata?
	Stream support
	ability to configure display for current playlist ("%a - %t", etc)
	allow drag-n-drop of multiple items

Future:
	connect in background via socket.setblocking(0)
	border around album art?
	use threading for album art
	switch to pygtk's statusicon (2.10) and remove gnome-python dep
		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed
	optional statusbar (num songs, total length, etc)?

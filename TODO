	setting to stop playback on exit, other settings
	retain selection after dnd
	ability to set art from local image?
	ability to configure columns for playlist
	ability to show column headings for sorting

		- then we can finally use skip_taskbar_hint since we will
		  be able to reliably detect if the sysicon is displayed

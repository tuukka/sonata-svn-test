v1.3
	queueing with multiple playlist columns: adjust column widths better?
	why the heck doesn't the treeviewcolumn header arrow update when sorting is reversed?

v1.4
	pref for lyrics saving location..
	allow additional columns for library (like current)
	genre mode (genre -> artist -> album)
	better playlist support (mpd 0.13 only):
		playlist tab:
			ability to view songs, reorder songs, remove songs, etc
		current tab:
			- save... >
				new playlist...
				to existing playlist... ---> popup window with dropdown of playlists
				...
	make selection, dnd, more like thunar
	dnd from other tabs to playlist tabs
	
Future:
	libnotify?
	test multiple streams at once..
	crop songs in current playlist?
	mpd statistics
	hover over album art -> show larger image in borderless popup after 0.5 sec?
	use GtkVolumeButton?

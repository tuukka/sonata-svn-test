			<p><b>Usage</b>

			<p>Sonata is designed to be an elegant and intuitive interface for your
			music collection. The main window can be collapsed into a "mini" view or
			expanded by clicking on the current song (with the ">" next to it). 
			Additional information, like song tags, album info, and lyrics, are
			available in a secondary window that can be brought up by clicking on
			the album art/cd in the top-left of the player, or by right-clicking
			anywhere in the top of the player and choosing "song info".
			
			<p>Sonata's tabbed interface includes your current playlist, your library 
			(browse by filesystem, artists, or albums), your saved playlists, and
			any streams (pls/m3u is supported). Most actions are accessed through
			right-click popup menus.

			<p>Optional features: For systemtray support, PyGTK 2.10 or 
			gnome-python-extras is required. For the ability to edit song tags, 
			tagpy and taglib are required. For automatic fetching of song lyrics,
			SOAPpy is required.

			<p><b>Hidden Features</b>

			<p>Remote Artwork - If remote artwork is enabled, Sonata will automatically search 
			amazon.com for cover art and display the best match if one is found. You can also 
			browse from amazon.com alternatives, or specify your own search terms, by 
			right-clicking on the album art/cd and choosing "Use Remote Image...".

			<p>Local Artwork - If local artwork is enabled, Sonata will search for a cover.jpg
			or folder.jpg file in the song's directory. Additionally, if there is only one image
			in the song's directory, it	will be chosen for display. (Note that these capabilities 
			require your music_directory in Preferences be to specified.) Finally, you can also 
			right-click on the album art/cd and choose "Use Local Image..." to specify your own 
			image (or just drag and drop the image onto the interface).
			
			<p>Tag Editing - Sonata provides a pretty powerful tag editing interface, similar
			to that found in EasyTag. You can select multiple files (or even folders) and apply
			user changes to all selected files by clicking on the small button next to a given
			field.

			<p>Song Formatting - Sonata provides the user with flexibility to define how songs
			are displayed in various places in the player. Note that you can enclose song formatting
			in curly brackets so that enclosed information only shows up if <i>all</i> of the 
			enclosed tags are found. For example, "{%T_}%A - %S{ [%B]}" will show 
			"07_Pearl Jam - Oceans [Ten]" if the track and album information exists, and 
			"Pearl Jam - Oceans" if neither tag exists.

			<p>Find-As-You-Type - All of the lists have find-as-you-type navigation. If
			the list has focus, press ctrl-f or just start typing (i.e. "ben") and you will
			automatically be taken to the first entry in the list that starts with "ben".
			Note that this is not case sensitive, so "Ben" will also be found.

			<p>Window Toggling - You can set a shortcut with your window manager to call
			"sonata --toggle" in order to quickly make the application visible or minimized
			to the system tray. Note that this requires D-BUS.
			
			<p>Commandline arguments - Sonata has some playback arguments such that you can
			set your own keybindings to actions like play or pause. Type "sonata --help" to
			see the full list of available arguments.
